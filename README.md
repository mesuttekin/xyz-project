#### Prerequisites:
This project is developed with Python. So before start please install Python if you don't have it already

* Python3
* PIP
* Virtualenv
```
brew install python3

python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
```

Below python features and extensions are used within the project. 
* Flask-Bcrypt: A Flask extension that provides bcrypt hashing utilities for your application.
* Flask-Migrate: An extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic. The database operations are made available through the Flask command-line interface or through the Flask-Script extension.
* Flask-SQLAlchemy: An extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy to your application.
* PyJWT: A Python library which allows you to encode and decode JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is an open, industry-standard (RFC 7519) for representing claims securely between two parties.

Please follow below steps to install prerequisites.
```
git clone https://github.com/mesuttekin/xyz-reality-project.git
cd xyz-reality-project
python3.8 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Database Models and Migration:
To perform the migration please run the following commands on the project root directory:

1. Initiate a migration folder using init command for alembic to perform the migrations.
```
python manage.py db init
```
2. Create a migration script from the detected changes in the model using the migrate command. This doesnâ€™t affect the database yet.

```
python manage.py db migrate --message 'initial database migration'
```
3. Apply the migration script to the database by using the upgrade command

```
python manage.py db upgrade
```
If everything runs successfully, you should have a new sqlLite database
xyz_reality_main.db file generated inside the main package.

 Note: Each time the database model changes, repeat the migrate and upgrade commands

#### Run Application:

You can run the application with the command below in the project root directory

```
python manage.py run
```

#### Test Application:

You can run the unit tests of the application with the command below in the project root directory
